## [Generic] Proposal


#### An [OpeningDETAIL](http://openingdetail.com/) Proposal for Construction Document Services

####
---
FOR:

XXX

<!--

---


Hi Anders,

We're excited about the potential of working together again.

Thank you for the opportunity to share the following proposal.

Although a more nuanced list of requirements will undoubtedly unfold as the project evolves, on a high-level, we understand that the project will include the following list of requirements/priorities...

- Help developing and drafting small scale construction (3"=1'-0") details for McElroy Residence in Newport Beach, CA.
- The details will be modeled per the workflow outlined in the **CD Documentation** section below. 

-->

---

## Workflow Options

Over the years, OpeningDETAIL has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [About page](http://openingdetail.com/a-little-more-about-us/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted **out-in-the-open**.

Simply put, this way of working allows OpeningDETAIL and [our extended team of global collaborators](http://openingdetail.com/people/), to be more efficient--ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address [our client]'s potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:
<br>

### Approach A
 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where all the newly created documentation, the project location, and the names of the parties involved in the project *(essentially those listed in the project's title block)* are known and are shared publicly.  All of OpeningDETAIL's newly created documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)—licensed to both [our client] and OpeningDETAIL.  That is, will be freely available to you, or any party, for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution) are honored. 
	 * **The following are sample projects, from our sister company OpeningDesign, that used this approach:**
		 * A **Sport Complex** in Jefferson, WI, the files (CAD/BIM) of which can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex) and a log of communication that happened between the design team and general contractor, [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex/issues?q=is:issue+is:closed+sort:comments-desc).
		 * A **Vacation Rental** project in Lake Geneva, WI.  The (CAD/BIM) documents can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Vacation_Rental) and the log of communication between the design team can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Vacation_Rental/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acomments-desc).

<br>

### Approach B
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the project location and the names of the direct or indirect clients, are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all of OpeningDETAIL's newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)—licensed to both [our client] and OpeningDETAIL.  
	 * **The following is a sample project that used this approach:**
		 * A residence in Laguna Beach, CA, of which the (CAD/BIM) files can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Laguna_Beach_Residence/tree/master/Models%20%26%20CAD/BIM).
		 * Although currently in progress, [here's](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Newport_Beach_CA_Residence/tree/master/Models%20&%20CAD/BIM) the CAD/BIM files for a residence in Newport Beach, CA.
			 * If curious, [here's](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#Newport_Beach_Residence:matrix.org/$15423149597772kkDZi:matrix.org) the public chat room we are using during the duration of this project.

<br>

### Approach C
 * **Approach &#40;C): A More Traditional Closed Approach** where all documentation, and clients involved, remains confidential and private.  Other than any previous open source content used to compose the CD set, [our client] are deemed the authors and owners of the resultant construction documents (Instruments of Service), and retain all common law and statutory rights, including copyright.

<br>

> - Please note, no matter which approach (A, B, or C) is used above...
> 	-  Any construction documents and/or the associated digital (BIM/CAD) files [our client] provide prior and/or during the project **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.  Only the construction details (as it applies to Approach A & B only) that OpeningDETAIL composes, will be open source and developed out-in-the-open.
> 	- Any prior emails, or any emails between [our client] and OpeningDETAIL, or any other parties during the duration of the project, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Also, we will not make public anything that [our client] explicitly indicates should be kept private.

 - ***Please note, the allocation percentages of the various skill levels is a rough estimate.  They may change during the project.***
<!-- - Add an additional 10% to accommodate match [our client]'s BIM standards
	 - Certain standards, cannot be accommodated. 
-->

>We have found using hourly rates, opposed to lump sums, are win-win for both parties.  OpeningDETAIL has a little more safeguard against potential [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and the client can realize more economical fees if they are able to make decisions quicker and more consistently--moving the design of the project along quicker.  
>
>In addition, clients are able to adjust, on the fly, what types of services they might or might not need as the project unfolds.
>
>Also, since OpeningDETAIL invoices every two weeks, [our client] is able to judge, on a more frequent basis, how efficient our services are.

## A Rough Estimate

Although our proposal is based on an hourly rate alone, to give [our client] a ballpark figure,  under typical conditions, we estimate each small scale (3" = 1'-0") detail will be between...
- Approach A: $205-$225
- Approach B: $225-$245
- Approach C: $245-$265

<!--
At roughly (65) details *(as outlined in [our client]'s recent marked up PDF)* it would be between...
- Approach A: $10,725-$12,025
- Approach B: $12,025-$13,325
- Approach C: $13,325-$14,625
-->
Obviously, the cost per detail will be more at first, as we get up to speed with desired materials and construction methods, but the more details we do, the more efficient we will be. 

Also, the more design iteration we do with [our client], the higher the cost per detail will be.

In addition, the more we're able to tap into our existing library of details, the lower these costs will be.


---


## Reimbursable expenses include:




* Transportation in connection with the project for travel authorized by the client (transportation, lodging and meals)
	* $0.54 per mile for travel
* Communication and shipping costs (long distance charges, courier, postage, dedicated web hosting, etc.)
* Reproduction costs for plans, sketches, drawings, graphic representations and other documents
* Renderings, models, prints of computer-generated drawings, mock-ups specifically	requested	 by the client
* Certification and documentation costs for third party	certification	such	as	LEED®
* Fees, levies, duties or taxes for permits, licences, or approvals from authorities having jurisdiction
* Additional insurance coverage or limits, including additional professional liability insurance requested by the client in a excess of that normally carried by the architect and the architect’s consultants
* Direct expenses from additional consultants not specifically outlined in this proposal
* Meals and lodging, when required to travel overnight 


*Reimbursable expenses include an additional 10% to cover in-house administration,	handling,	and	financing.*

<br>

## Typical Workflow & Technologies
<br>

### Communication


From the onset, and throughout the duration of the project, we like to keep the communication with our clients as frequent and as transparent as possible. It varies from project to project, but we often use the following platforms for both verbal and graphic communication.  Of those listed here, they are either free, or we pay for our client's access during the project. We are also open to [our client]'s preferred communication channels as well.


* Screensharing
	* [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us)
* IM for quick one-off conversations
	* [Riot.im](https://riot.im/app)
		* [Here's](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Newport_Beach_CA_Residence/tree/master/Models%20&%20CAD/BIM) a public example
* Graphical IM (real-time sketching over imported screenshots)
	* [EtherDraw](http://sketch.openingdesign.com/)
* Issue Tracking
	* [Github](https://github.com/)
		* [Here's](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex/issues?q=is:issue+is:closed+sort:comments-desc)  an example
* Graphical Issue Tracking and Redlining
	* Simple PDF markups.
	* Web-based markup tools:
		* [PlanGrid](https://plangrid.com/)
		* [RealtimeBoard](https://realtimeboard.com/)

<br>

### CD Documentation

Using a combination of [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-family/overview), [IFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes), [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) & [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/) Scripts, **OpeningDETAIL** uses a unique methodology to compose our client's small scale details.  Instead of 2D fills, lines, and simple text annotation, as is typically done with details in Revit, we model our details in 3D.  By attaching various material assignments to these 3D objects, along with Revit's intelligent **Material Tag** and a custom **Dynamo Script**, we are able to automate the annotation of these details.

Also, by using 3D and the open [IFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes) format, we are able to roundtrip our details between FreeCAD and Revit.  This, along with the automated annotation, in part, allows us to keep costs down.  

During the project, at milestone issuances, (or at any requested interval), we are happy to share the following file formats with [our client].
* Revit
* DWGs
* PDFs
* IFC

<br>

### File Hosting
Internally, OpeningDETAIL uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) for file sharing and version tracking of files. Although it is not required that [our client] use Github, if they so choose, they are welcome to sync our the project [repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) at any time.  

Although there is a slight learning curve to its use, more graphical interfaces, such as Github's [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), make it a little easier to sync files.

<br>

## Sample Projects

* If so inclined, to get a sense of our work, please review the following open source sample projects (Revit & PDFs) OpeningDETAIL has done over the years. 
	* [Project 1](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Sample_Projects/tree/master/Sample%20Projects/Project%201)
	* [Project 2](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Sample_Projects/tree/master/Sample%20Projects/Project%202)
	* [Project 3](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Sample_Projects/tree/master/Sample%20Projects/Project%203)
	* [Project 4](https://github.com/OpeningDETAIL/Sample_Projects/tree/master/Sample%20Projects/Project%204%20-%20Laguna%20Beach)

<br>

---

## Boilerplate

* OpeningDETAIL will deliver invoices every 2 weeks based on scope complete, with payment due within 30 days of receipt.  Invoices overdue past (60) days will be interpreted as an order to stop work on the project. 
* This proposal is valid for 90 days. 
<br>
